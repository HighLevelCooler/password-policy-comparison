### Analysis of 10 Password Policies using Dropbox's zxcvbn


_Installation and Usage instructions_:
1. Download the repo from the main branch as a zip file.
2. Unzip/Extract the downloaded file to a folder, which should be named as `password-policy-comparison` by default.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder, enter the 'password-policy-comparison-main' subfolder and click on and run multi.py
    - multi.py can also be run through the command line. 
4. Input the name of the folder containing the password files, leave blank or put 0 if the files are in the current directory.
5. Resultant text files will be computed and moved a new subfolder, by default it's `'ResultsDirectory-v0`.
6. A converter program handles the transmutation of text files to csv files for better parsing and further analysis.
7. Whole process will take about ~9 minutes.
